            <li>1/2 cup [80g] salted preserved dried radish</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely shredded purple cabbage</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prepare Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the salted preserved radish, soak them in cold water for 30 mins, then rinse.</li>
            <li>Sauté them in a pan with some oil for 1 min, season with 1/2 teaspoon sugar (omit if using sweetened dried radish/skip this step if using pickles)</li>
            <li>To make the tofu, heat a non-stick pan with 3 teaspoons oil, sauté mashed tofu until golden brown and season with soy sauce. Set aside.⁣</li>
            <li>Using the same pan, sauté Gailan stems until fully cooked through & season with salt. Set aside.⁣</li>
            <li>Cut YouTiao into 3-inch long and bake at 350F until crispy, about 5-8 mins.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>How to wrap Fan Tuan</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the stuffed rice rolls, wrap a paper towel or sushi mat with a layer of plastic wrap or wax paper.</li>
            <li>Lay the wrapped mat or paper towel on a flat surface, then sprinkle with a pinch of sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Scoop about 3/4 cup of rice and place onto the surface, on top of the sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Using a silicon or rice spatula, spread the rice to a thin layer by pressing the rice down into a rectangular shape.</li>
            <li>Add a heaping spoon of tofu in the middle and top with youtiao.</li>
            <li>Add a tablespoon of greens, cooked preserved radish, and purple cabbage. Top with a heaping spoon of crushed peanuts if preferred.</li>
            <li>Now, lift both sides of the wrapper up and use your finger to push the filling onto the rice.</li>
            <li>Bring the long sides to the middle and fold them in a hot dog style. Use the side of the wrapper to push both ends so the rice sticks together. (think of how you wrap a candy)</li>
            <li>Then, twist both ends several times so the rice roll is packed like a log. Tip: Transfer roll to a wrap, tighten & keep it wrapped while cutting or serving.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with more toasted sesame seeds on the outer layer. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
